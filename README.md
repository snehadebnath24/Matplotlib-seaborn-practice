# Matplotlib & Seaborn Practice

This repository is for learning and practicing data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.


## 🎨 Matplotlib Topics Covered

- Basic plots: line plot, scatter plot, bar chart, histogram, pie plot.
- Customization: titles, labels, legends, colors, markers, line styles, gridlines and styles.

## 🎨 Seaborn Topics Covered

### 1. Relational Plots (show relationships between two variables)

- scatterplot() – scatter plot
- lineplot() – line plot

### 2. Categorical Plots (show distribution across categories)
- stripplot() – individual points along a category
- swarmplot() – like stripplot, but points don’t overlap
- boxplot() – shows median, quartiles, outliers
- violinplot() – combines boxplot with kernel density
- barplot() – aggregate value per category with confidence interval
- countplot() – counts per category
- pointplot() – shows mean/estimate and confidence intervals

### 3. Distribution Plots (show distribution of a single variable)
- histplot() – histogram
- kdeplot() – kernel density estimate
- displot() – figure-level distribution plot (histogram + KDE)

### 4. Matrix Plots (show data in grid/matrix form)
- heatmap() – color-coded matrix

### 5. Regression Plots (show trends with regression lines)
- regplot() – scatter + regression line

### 6. Pair and Joint Plots (show relationships between multiple variables)
- pairplot() – scatter/relationship matrix
- pairgrid() – flexible pairwise plot grid
- jointplot() – scatter or regression for two variables + marginal plots

### 7. Time-Series Plots
- Use lineplot() with a datetime x-axis

## 🏆 Goals

- Learn Matplotlib and Seaborn step by step using Python lists, arrays, and datasets
- Practice creating different types of plots
- Build confidence in customizing, styling, and saving charts
- Explore datasets visually to gain insights
